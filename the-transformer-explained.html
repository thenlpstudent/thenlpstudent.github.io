It is based around an encoder-decoder architecture to handle and process sequential data in parallel. In addition, it uses a mechanism known as Attention to look back and forwards the sequential input and identify long-range patterns and relationships between each component in the sequence.<br><br>The transformer architecture solves the shortcomings of recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks when processing sequential data and making good predictions.<br><br>Recurrent neural networks aren't capable of processing sequential data in parallel. Therefore it increases training time since we can't utilize the full power of GPU processing units for parallel matrix multiplication if data is processed sequentially.<br><br>Convolutional neural networks can also process sequential data in parallel. But due to their window size, they can only look back and forward the input sequence, making them unable to identify good long-distance relationships between the entire sequence.<br><br>The attention mechanism can look at the whole input sequence at once and identify the long-distance relationships of every element (i.e. word) in the sequence with every other element of the sequence, which is why transformers, in general, perform better when it comes to sequential data processing.</p><h2 id="the-big-picturenbsp">The Big Picture&nbsp;</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/transformer-outline.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-xs.png 300w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-sm.png 480w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-md.png 768w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-lg.png 1024w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-xl.png 1360w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-2xl.png 1600w" height="669" width="768" alt=""><figcaption>High level overview of the transformer architecture and it's key components</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a nutshell, the transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture, where N (N=5 in the different encoding layers encode the input sequences, and N different decoder layers decode the information encoded by the encoding layers to predict the next word in sequence, depending on the NLP task at hand.<br><br>Before sending the input sequences into the encoder layers or to the decoder layers of the transformer, word embeddings and positional embeddings preprocess the input sequences so that the transformer can process the data more intuitively and effectively.<br><br>We will discuss the concept of word embedding and positional embedding once we dive more deeply into the inner workings of the transformer.<br><br>These encoder layers are stacked on top of each other.
