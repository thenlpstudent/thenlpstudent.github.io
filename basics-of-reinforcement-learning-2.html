The reward signal is given by the environment depending on how well the agent performed in that environment.<br><br>Reinforcement learning is a computational approach that learns from interaction with an environment. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to maximize a numerical reward signal.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="what-is-a-rewardnbsp">What is a reward?&nbsp;</h3><p>A reward is a simple number given to the agent by the environment each time the agent interacts with the environment. The agent's goal is to maximize then the total amount of reward it receives, which means that the agent needs to maximize the cumulative reward in the long term, not the immediate reward in the short term.</p><h3 id="the-reward-hypothesisnbsp">The Reward Hypothesis&nbsp;</h3><p>The reward hypothesis states that an RL agent's goal is to maximize the expected value of the received scalar signal's cumulative reward.<br><br>Therefore, reinforcement learning gets based on learning methods that maximize the total cumulative reward by taking actions that help reach this goal.</p><h2 id="components-in-reinforcement-learning">Components in Reinforcement learning</h2><p>The two main components in any reinforcement learning-based algorithm are known as the agent and the environment.</p><h3 id="the-agent-and-the-enviroment">The Agent and the Enviroment</h3><p>An agent is a learner and the decision-maker inside an environment. The agent observes the environment and takes action, which is how the agent interacts with the environment. The environment then gives a reward to that agent based on the agent's action at that particular time and situation.<br><br>Everything that is outside of the agent is known as the environment.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-markov-state">What is the Markov State?</h3><p>In RL, understanding the concept of a state is vital. The state is the information that we use to determine what might happen next. Simply put, the state is a function of history.<br><br>The agent has its state, in which case the agent's state is the function of the agent's history and experiences collected by interacting with the environment.<br><br>The environment also has its state, known as the environment state.<br><br>The agent's or the environment's state is a Markov state if the current state is independent of the past. This is because the past information (history) gets derived from the current state. Therefore the state doesn't depend on history.<br><br>"The future is independent of the past given the present" - and future states can be computed from the current state, and the history can be discarded.<br><br>Suppose the agent can access the environment state. In that case, the mathematical model of the RL problem is known as a fully observable Markov decision process, whereas if the agent cannot access the state of the environment, then it's known as a partially observable Markov decision process.</p><h3 id="returns-episodes-and-continuous-tasks">Returns, Episodes and Continuous Tasks</h3><p>The agent's goal is to maximize the total cumulative reward it receives from the environment over time.<br><br>To understand more about the return, we formalize it as follows. This is the basic form of the expected return, which is just the sum of all rewards gathered till the agent reaches the terminal state of the environment (last state of interaction with the environment) from some timestep t. Capital T denotes the final timestep.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/mc11ifjj.bmp" height="56" width="344" alt=""></figure><p>Depending on the environment, the agent can work in episodic tasks or continuing tasks.<br><br><br>An episodic task ends at a specific terminal state S+ with different rewards for different outcomes. (All nonterminal states denoted as S.)<br><br>E.g., winning and losing a game of chess, the next episode or next game begins independently of how the previous game ended) The terminal state ends, and the environment resets back into a starting state.<br><br><br>Continous tasks don't have a terminal state. Therefore they go on without a limit. Here taking the total cumulative reward is tricky because the total cumulative reward will be T = ∞.<br><br>Now we introduce a notation known as the discount factor, a value between 0 and 1. This is so that in continuous environments, the total cumulative reward would not be ∞.<br>If we set the discount factor closer to 0, the agent tends to try and optimize to get higher immediate rewards. On the other hand, if the discount factor is closer to 1, the agent looks ahead to long-term rewards.<br><br>Therefore the agent now tries to select actions that maximize the sum of the discounted rewards (discounted return) it receives from timestep t onwards. So at each state, the agent tries to pick the best action at timestep t that maximizes the expected discounted return:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/ly2wxwmw.bmp" height="66" width="522" alt=""></figure><p>In the following manner, the current expected discounted return at timestep t relates with the future discounted return at time step t+1.<br><br>Thus, the current expected discounted return is the immediate reward at timestep t plus the discounted expected return at time step t+1.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/709gqe0n.bmp" height="100" width="408" alt=""></figure><h3 id="what-are-value-functions-and-policiesnbspnbsp">What are value functions and policies?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Two other essential concepts in Reinforcement Learning are the value function and the policy function of an RL agent.<br><br>The value function of an RL agent describes how 'good' a state is in the long run.<br><br>It's a function that maps a state to a value that describes how much total expected discounted return the agent would get if the agent takes actions starting from that given state.<br><br>The policy is a function that maps a state with a given action.<br><br>Next, it describes how the behavior of the agent would be in the environment. Finally, it defines a way in which the agent would interact with the environment.<br>The policy function can either be discrete or stochastic, in the sense that it can map to certain actions based on an argmax function, where it picks the action that has the highest return (a greedy policy), or picks an action based on a probabilistic distribution.</p><h2 id="the-markov-decision-process-mdp">The Markov Decision Process (MDP)</h2><p>The Markov Decision Process is a classic formalization of sequential decision making, where actions influence the immediate reward at time step t and future states those actions and the rewards at those future states.<br><br>The MDP process formalizes and helps us derive equations on dealing with the trade-off between immediate and delayed rewards.<br><br>There are two types of values that we estimate by using an MDP, so that we can better deal with the immediate and delayed reward trade-off.<br><br>We estimate the optimal value function that gives each state S's best possible value given optimal action selections.<br><br>We also estimate the optimal action-value function, which takes in as arguments the action and the state the agent is in and gives how good of an action that action is depending on the state.<br><br>Estimating these state-dependent quantities is essential to accurately assign credit to the agent's actions in the environment to make decisions better to effectively trade-off between immediate and delayed rewards.<br><br>The agent would observe the current state at time step t and get the current reward from transitioning into that state. Then, the state would take action, which hopefully maximizes the discounted return for the next timestep.<br><br>The environment would process this action if the environment would produce the next state and reward the agent for moving into the new state.<br><br><br>This is how the agent and the environment interact with each other. The agent's goal is to behave optimally in this environment, which is done by maximizing the total discounted return over time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/4-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-xs.png 300w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-sm.png 480w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-md.png 768w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-lg.png 1024w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-xl.png 1360w, https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/4-2-2xl.png 1600w" height="333" width="768" alt=""></figure><p>While interacting with the environment, this would be the sequential history the agent goes through.<br><br>For example, the agent starts at timestep 0, observes the state, takes action, and obtains a reward, and this cycle repeats.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/d45aue3n.bmp" height="49" width="433" alt=""></figure><p>The MDP describes the probability in which the agent transitions from one state to the next.<br><br>The likelihood that given the agent is in a given state 's' and takes action' a', the likelihood that that agent would end up in a new state " s' " and gets a reward 'r' is described as follows,&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/crx7v8av.bmp" height="56" width="588" alt=""></figure><p>The probability in taking action 'a' from state 's' and transitioning to state " s' " is the summation for all rewards in set R (all possible reward values in the MDP), and their transition probability of starting at state 's', taking action 'a', transitioning to state " s' " and getting probability 'r' for all rewards in set R.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/4xbzp16f.bmp" height="103" width="710" alt=""></figure><p>The expected reward for choosing action a from state s can be described as the summation of all rewards in R weighted over all the state transition probabilities from state 's', taking action 'a', landing in the state " s' " and getting a reward 'r' afterward.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/sx8psqdw.bmp" height="77" width="670" alt=""></figure><p>The expected reward the agent will receive at the current state " s' " given that the previous state and action was 's' and 'a', is the summation of all rewards R, weighted by the total probability of transitioning from state 's' to " s' " by taking action 'a' over the probability of transitioning from state 's' to " s' " by taking action 'a' and getting a specific reward 'r' in R.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/3/tc008l17.bmp" height="78" width="737" alt=""></figure><p>Here it shows that the probability of transitioning from all states " s' " and getting all rewards 'r' from those states given that the agent was in state 's' and takes action 'a' sums to 1.

below equation shows that the value function when the agent uses a given policy π and starts at state s, is equivalent by the MDP to the expectation of the total discounted return from timestep t
