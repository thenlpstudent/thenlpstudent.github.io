The reward signal is given by the environment depending on how well the agent performed in that environment. \n<br>\n<br>Reinforcement learning is a computational approach that learns from interaction with an environment. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to maximize a numerical reward signal.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"what-is-a-rewardnbsp\">\n      What is a reward?&nbsp;\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    A reward is a simple number given to the agent by the environment each time the agent interacts with the environment. The agent's goal is to maximize then the total amount of reward it receives, which means that the agent needs to maximize the cumulative reward in the long term, not the immediate reward in the short term.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-reward-hypothesisnbsp\">\n      The Reward Hypothesis&nbsp;\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The reward hypothesis states that an RL agent's goal is to maximize the expected value of the received scalar signal's cumulative reward. \n<br>\n<br>Therefore, reinforcement learning gets based on learning methods that maximize the total cumulative reward by taking actions that help reach this goal.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"components-in-reinforcement-learning\">\n      Components in Reinforcement learning\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The two main components in any reinforcement learning-based algorithm are known as the agent and the environment.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-agent-and-the-enviroment\">\n      The Agent and the Enviroment\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    An agent is a learner and the decision-maker inside an environment. The agent observes the environment and takes action, which is how the agent interacts with the environment. The environment then gives a reward to that agent based on the agent's action at that particular time and situation. \n<br>\n<br>Everything that is outside of the agent is known as the environment.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"what-is-the-markov-state\">\n      What is the Markov State?\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    In RL, understanding the concept of a state is vital. The state is the information that we use to determine what might happen next. Simply put, the state is a function of history. \n<br>\n<br>The agent has its state, in which case the agent's state is the function of the agent's history and experiences collected by interacting with the environment.\n<br>\n<br>The environment also has its state, known as the environment state. \n<br>\n<br>The agent's or the environment's state is a Markov state if the current state is independent of the past. This is because the past information (history) gets derived from the current state. Therefore the state doesn't depend on history. \n<br>\n<br>\"The future is independent of the past given the present\" - and future states can be computed from the current state, and the history can be discarded. \n<br>\n<br>Suppose the agent can access the environment state. In that case, the mathematical model of the RL problem is known as a fully observable Markov decision process, whereas if the agent cannot access the state of the environment, then it's known as a partially observable Markov decision process.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"returns-episodes-and-continuous-tasks\">\n      Returns, Episodes and Continuous Tasks\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The agent's goal is to maximize the total cumulative reward it receives from the environment over time. \n<br>\n<br>To understand more about the return, we formalize it as follows. This is the basic form of the expected return, which is just the sum of all rewards gathered till the agent reaches the terminal state of the environment (last state of interaction with the environment) from some timestep t. Capital T denotes the final timestep.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/returneq-md.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-xs.PNG 300w ,file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-sm.PNG 480w ,file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-md.PNG 768w ,file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-lg.PNG 1024w ,file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-xl.PNG 1360w ,file:///C:/Users/chirath/Documents/Publii/sites/the-nlp-student/input/media/posts/temp/responsive/returneq-md-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  height=\"56\" width=\"344\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Depending on the environment, the agent can work in episodic tasks or continuing tasks.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>An episodic task ends at a specific terminal state S+ with different rewards for different outcomes.

Finally, it defines a way in which the agent would interact with the environment.\n<br>The policy function can either be discrete or stochastic, in the sense that it can map to certain actions based on an argmax function, where it picks the action that has the highest return (a greedy policy), or picks an action based on a probabilistic distribution.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-markov-decision-process-mdp\">\n      The Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The Markov Decision Process is a classic formalization of sequential decision making, where actions influence the immediate reward at time step t and future states those actions and the rewards at those future states. \n<br>\n<br>The MDP process formalizes and helps us derive equations on dealing with the trade-off between immediate and delayed rewards. \n<br>\n<br>There are two types of values that we estimate by using an MDP, so that we can better deal with the immediate and delayed reward trade-off. \n<br>\n<br>We estimate the optimal value function that gives each state S's best possible value given optimal action selections. \n<br>\n<br>We also estimate the optimal action-value function, which takes in as arguments the action and the state the agent is in and gives how good of an action that action is depending on the state. \n<br>\n<br>Estimating these state-dependent quantities is essential to accurately assign credit to the agent's actions in the environment to make decisions better to effectively trade-off between immediate and delayed rewards. \n<br>\n<br>The agent would observe the current state at time step t and get the current reward from transitioning into that state. Then, the state would take action, which hopefully maximizes the discounted return for the next timestep. \n<br>\n<br>The environment would process this action if the environment would produce the next state and reward the agent for moving into the new state. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>This is how the agent and the environment interact with each other. The agent's goal is to behave optimally in this environment, which is done by maximizing the total discounted return over time.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image

It is based around an encoder-decoder architecture to handle and process sequential data in parallel. In addition, it uses a mechanism known as Attention to look back and forwards the sequential input and identify long-range patterns and relationships between each component in the sequence.\n<br>\n<br>The transformer architecture solves the shortcomings of recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks when processing sequential data and making good predictions. \n<br>\n<br>Recurrent neural networks aren't capable of processing sequential data in parallel. Therefore it increases training time since we can't utilize the full power of GPU processing units for parallel matrix multiplication if data is processed sequentially.\n<br>\n<br>Convolutional neural networks can also process sequential data in parallel. But due to their window size, they can only look back and forward the input sequence, making them unable to identify good long-distance relationships between the entire sequence. \n<br>\n<br>The attention mechanism can look at the whole input sequence at once and identify the long-distance relationships of every element (i.e. word) in the sequence with every other element of the sequence, which is why transformers, in general, perform better when it comes to sequential data processing.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-big-picturenbsp\">\n      The Big Picture&nbsp;\n    </h2>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/transformer-outline.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-xs.png 300w ,https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-sm.png 480w ,https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-md.png 768w ,https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-lg.png 1024w ,https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-xl.png 1360w ,https://thenlpstudent.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/transformer-outline-2xl.png 1600w\"  height=\"669\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" />\n      <figcaption>High level overview of the transformer architecture and it's key components</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    &nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In a nutshell, the transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture, where N (N=5 in the  different encoding layers encode the input sequences, and N different decoder layers decode the information encoded by the encoding layers to predict the next word in sequence, depending on the NLP task at hand.  \n<br>\n<br>Before sending the input sequences into the encoder layers or to the decoder layers of the transformer, word embeddings and positional embeddings preprocess the input sequences so that the transformer can process the data more intuitively and effectively. \n<br>\n<br> We will discuss the concept of word embedding and positional embedding once we dive more deeply into the inner workings of the transformer.\n<br>\n<br>These encoder layers are stacked on top of each other.
